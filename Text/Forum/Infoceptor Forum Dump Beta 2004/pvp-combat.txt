Aim: To generate the system that rewards players for killing the opposite faction, that cannot be exploited by griefers and still makes the game fun for casual players. To generate an atmosphere of total war bettween factions that escalate is massive battles, while allowing those who do not wish to participate to quest in peace.

A Plausible System:

When designing a PVP system, one has to be careful. On the one hard, you want it to satisfy hardcore players, who love the idea of going head to head against other humans. On the other hand, you've got casual players and newbies, who would much rather complete quests.... keeping them both happy will be hard.

The most obvious option, of course would be to say:

QUOTE
Players of Opposite Factions Auto Attack Each Other.


Personally, I'd love this... and I'm sure many other people would too. Imagine armies of alliance players charging into a Orc base, with the Orcs holding up a Stalwart Defense... Hundreds vs Hundreds! WoW! Yet there are problems.

In MMORPG, there's bound to be griefers, and there's a hell of a lot of ways you can grief with such a system. Imagine you as a Level 5 Warrior, busy dispatching those Level 6 Kobolds in Elwynn Forest to collect their candles... when out of blue comes a Level 40 orc.. BAM! Grom hits you for 320 Damage, you are dead. He then proceeds to guard the Kobold Mine, killing any newbie that tries to complete the quest. Just one such incident will be enough to cause a casual player to log off... and never play the game again.

So let us modify the rule a bit, say:

QUOTE
Players of Opposite Factions Auto Attack Each Other provided the on within X levels of each other.


That will solve the griefing problem! Or will it? If X is anywhere greator than 3 levels, higher levelled players with still have a huge advantage, and if we make X less than 3, most players who meet each other can't fight. Or how about this scenerio?

You're a Level 20 Orc, doing 'Weapons of Choice', a quest that involves a 15 minute run from the nearest Graveyard, right at the far southern end of the Barrens. All is going well, your party can take on the mobs, though as the game is now, it's a challenging task. There are several close calls... but its all cool. You have a Shaman for resurrect, and the difficult keeps the action tense. You engage another Quilboar, its tough, its a boss, and you sign you relief as you kill it was about 60 life to spare. Your party is still fighting the other boars and you turn to help.

Then bam! A Level 23 Rogue appears behind you, Ambushes for 200 damage, you're dead. Your party, distracted by the mobs, are no match for a rogue on full health from behind. He prompted kills your Shaman, and laughs, "LOL. YOU SUXOR!"

15 minutes later... you puff your way back. You get to your corpse, ressurect. Then Boom, Ambushed for 200, on half health as you are, and taken by surprise, you are no match for a character 3 levels higher. Within a minute, you're dead... another 15 minute run.

Suddenly, the PVP system doesn't sound so fun any more.

So do we have a solution? How about?

QUOTE
Players of Opposite Factions Auto Attack Each Other, but like Duels, the fight ends when an enemy is reduced to 1hp.


Much better this time, but that's still not going to get rid of creep abuse. You're fighting quillboars, Rogue Backstabs you, you lose 200 health. You have 1hp left... In 3 seconds, you're dead. Kill by the Searing Totem that the Quilboar Sorcerer has dropped. Gee...

So do we have any options left? On the one hand, we have lots of Unreal Tournament like fun, on the other, WoW is a MMORPG with creeps and a death penalty of a dreads corpse run. How do we balance the two so that players can have PVP as if it were Unreal Tournament, and yet be able to do Quests at the same time?

Now here's what we propose:

QUOTE
Players of Opposite Factions Auto Attack Each Other, the is no level restriction. HOWEVER!

Players have 2 separate Hp bars, one for fighting mobs, another for fighting players.

When a player engages a second player, he damages the other players PVP Hp bar exclusively. If he wins the fighter, the lose auto submits to the victor in surrender. He's icon on top they turns grey.

Once a player has surrendered to an opposite faction, he may no longer attack any members of the opposing faction for a set period of time (Say 15 minutes), and opponent factions see his icon as grey, signifying that he has surrendered, and cannot be further attacked. Players more surrender to a player at any time during a battle.

However, the PVP HP is Separate to that of the Normal Hp Bar. Thus even if a player is caught off guard while fighting other creeps, all that happens is that he can choose to surrender, and continue has battle against the creeps.


This way, a level 40 Character can jump into Elwynn Forest, and slaughter every player in his wake, causing every newbie in his paths to surrender. yet, newbies don't need to make a corpse run, don't need to worry about their quests being foiled... and cans till have fun.

Meanwhile, Blizzard can set up great competitions, ranking people on each faction based on the EXP worth of enemy faction players slaughtered, and set up some great PVP Quests.

Imagine a Quest where your goal is to Raid Westfall and slaughter 10 Alliance Players, or even better, a raid on Crossroads where you must assassinate an NPC sitting inside a tavern. Such a quest would obviously be elite, where, a super group of alliance players would break through crossroad city guards, bashing all players to surrender, and destroy the Tavern patron.

Of course, such a quest could auto enable a quest on the Orc Side to protect the Tavern Patron... and wha-la. We've got a PVP quest on our hands, that'll inevitably cause mass PVP Warfare... all without allowing the loophole for griefing.

While I understand an extra HP bar might be slightly difficult to rationalise, and may take a little time to implement. It'll certainly make WOW unique in its integration of PVP that'll appeal to both hardcore dualists and casual questers.

Experience Management

We propose that killing a player of equal level in Faction PVP will give the player who killed them equal EXP as killing a monster of around the 2 level above. This will make PVP Combat slight more difficult to gain EXP is, due to the fact that a player character is slightly tougher than such a monster. However, it still provides plenty of incentive to hack at a player of the enemy faction when you see them.

In traditional PVP Systems, this would be discoruaged, as it encourages a world where everyone slaughters everyone. But here, we have two separate factions, so epic warfare makes since. You're a Human, You see Orc, you kill it.

To discourage people taking on preoccupied players though, we can simply let players become tapped if they're attacked by someone else, just like monsters are. So if a player has engaged a Gnoll, then he'll become tapped, and killing such a player will yield no experience reward, nor count towards any ladder rankings.

And since killing such a player won't grief that player in anyway. There is absolutely no reason for players to take cheap shots at others as mentioned above.

Player vs Player Quests

The above system will allow us to inplement epic PVP Quests, such as an example below:

"LFG: Raid on Westfall"

Where Once a Week, All Players of high enough level of prompted an option to join this quest. Once joined, they form a supergroup of 100+ people that must co-ordinate the slaughter of all NPCs at Westfall, and keep at least 10 Orc Players within the Human keep alive for 30 minutes. Upon which, they succeed in Conquaring Westfall.

On the same day, all human players of high enough level at promoptd with the option to join "Defend Westfall Quest", where they must prevent the Horde Players in achieving their objective for the next 6 hours.

Success in defence means Westfall is working. Failure would mean that Westfall becomes a dead town for the next 24 hours.

A Ranking System

Now to satisfy the Power Gamers, who might be cringing at lack of a satifaction of seeing the guy the defeat just go along their business, we have a Ranking System.

Players Gain/Lose rating when they Win/Defeat an opponent in a system similar to Starcraft. Higher Rated Players will be given Ranks within the Alliance/Horde, perhaps special ornamental items such as 'Commander's Flag' that'll make them stand out for bragging rights.

If you're the Orc that killed lots of Highly Ranked Human Players, everyone in the Horde will know about it... Power Games will dig this!

Why This PVP System is Superior to Others

We now explain why this system is superior to a few of the commonly used solutions to PVP Combat. Mainly, this is due to the fact that we want World of Warcraft to feature epic battles!

QUOTE
Make it so Players Can only PVP in Certain Zones


This is well and great, as it keeps both sides fairly happy, but makes Warcraft miss one of the most fun elements, All out War! If you restrict PVP to certain Zones, then only people who actively want to PVP will go there. Now you can really put any proper quests in the Zones, due to the problems I mentioned above about griefing... as people may wish to just go there for Quests.

In addition, we won't want a PVP System, where people just pick off another player. That's being done, and its isn't fun. Higher Levels win, Lower Levels lose. And if only people who especially want to fight, fights, you may as well just keep with the Duel System. Because, hell, no one's going to go into a PVP Zone with no Quests just to PVP. And Adding quests in a PVP Zone will frustrate players who don't wish to die Questing while PVPings.

In addition, you won't be able to have epic battles. You lose the possibility of having epic quests like "Kill the Militia Captain of Westfall." Because well... that requires making Westfall a PVP Zone, and that's not going to fun for players there who just want to do the quests.

QUOTE
Give players a Checkbox that they tick for Faction Warfare

Again, no one's going to want to untick this box unless they're actively looking to kill other players. If you untick the box and just plan to quest, then you're asking to be killed while taking on an enemy creep. So people who have this box unticked have to watch out while killing creeps, that'll lower their creeping efficiency, and so they may as well have it ticked.

So what you get is everyone who has it unticked searching the world for other PVP players, and there won't be maybe. Maybe 5% at most, once again you'll lose the Epic Warfare feel of the game.

Also you can't make it so people can uncheck at any time, since then everyone will have it unchecked till they spot a weaker or pre-occupied player... which probably means that no one will fight anyone. Espeically if losing meant dying and corpse run. They'd just be better off Dueling with their own Faction..

Once again, you lose the epic Faction vs Faction feel.

QUOTE
Why not let everyone fight everyone, and Penalise Newbie Killers in some way, such as make then lose more EXP when they die?


Consider the attacking Westfall Scenerio. Now you're a Level 30, and you siege the base with 40 of your comrades. Now facing you are 3 Level 10s. In the proposed system, you would hack them into Submission and continue on, helping your teamates.

If we used a penalty System them, you would have shout.

"HELP! 3 Noobs here! I can't take them out sine that's gonna EXP penalise me!"

That seems a little ludicrous! The point is, we want to capture the War, and unlike other MMORPGS, Pking isn't about dueling another player, its about being part of an epic Orc vs Human Battle. If we want a PVP System for WoW, it'll have to be different from every other MMORPG.

QUOTE
There's no Incentive to win in the Your  System


Yes, a person can keep creeping even if he's been defeated by a player. Yes, a player doesn't need to defend himself. But there is a slight penality, the defeated player won't be able to PVP for a set amount of time. Casual players won't care much, but hard-core players won't like it one bit, because it means they can't participate in PVP Quests, and lost one source of experience.

Also, Blizzard can put down rankings such as Player Win Ratio etc, and the Top 10 War Heroes, things like that, which players will strive for. In addition, of course, we've got the Epic Warfare PVP Quests.

Now, does this mean Casual Players won't put up a fight? Unlikely! Provided a Casual Player isn't fighting a creep. He'll most likely fight back, because, heck, its fun to do and there's no permanent harm! So when you invade Westfall, you can expect every player trading there to grab the swords and fight you off. You'll have a massive battle on your hands!

QUOTE
Players Should not be able to Shrug of a PVP Death!


The beauty of this system is players can't. Players who care about PVP, and want to win in their faction ladder, will want to spend time beating other players to submission.

Consider Player A, a Hardcore PVPer. Suppose Player A is killed by a Player, it means he can't participate in PVP for X amount of time (Say, 1 hour). Compare this to a corpse run, which only takes 5 minutes. To a hardcore PVP Gamer, being killed by a Player will be 20 times worse than being killed by a Monster! Not only will he be down 20 times longer, he would have also lost rating, and thus ranking in the PVP Ladder.

Consider Player B, a Casual Player who does quests. While travalleing through the Barrens, he gets hit hard by a party Humans doing a PVP Quest. He shrugs, he's PVP Rating goes down, but he wasn't looking for a rank anyway. He gets on with his quest.

Thus, Players who care about PVP will care about the loss penalty. This is as how it should be, so that WOW can cater for both hardcore and casual players. What makes it better than just 'Tick the Box if you wanna PVP' option is that everyone can and will fight, so you can have epic battles.

Having talked extensively to a group of... Well, i guess you'd have to call them griefers much of the time, but they wouldn't call themselves that, there's a glaring problem with this:

Some PVPers want to PVP in order to teach the other person a lesson--or stop them from irritating them. This actually helps make the gameworld more polite, as most people don't say "OMGZ N00B I PWNZ J00" for no reason and constantly if that person they're irritating can up and slice their throat. Same with KSing and other forms of irritating (ninja looting)

Unfortunately, having someone die just because someone else felt they should is a problem, as it (as you've pointed out) makes griefing very possible in the "i-kill-you-kekekekke" sort of way.

I quite like your dual hp bars solution, but i propose an addendum:

When a player's PVP hp bar goes to zero, they fight at a slightly decreased eifficiency (as though they're tired, for example, gaining fewer xp from the mobs they kill), but this is a temporary problem, as they can solve it by sitting down and resting for, say, 5 minutes. In addition, it would slow them and enable a chat flood command (So they can't talk as much out loud or ninja loot as easily), as well as disable looting.

This allows people to say "Shut up, you're annoying"
This, of course, allows griefers to kill your pvp bar and then laugh as you have to sit down. But it isn't permanent, and they can't PVP you while your PVP bar is at zero, so it gives you a chance to get your distance from the person.

If they keep griefing beyond that, i'd suggest /petition.

Personally I feel that the above stuff should work nice, but I think another nice safety measure that should best be proposed is that people who would want to engage world wide pvp combat should have an option to do so. That way we don't have new players getting attacked who don't want to be.

Just simply make it so you can decide when you want to go pvp vs the other faction. Also another factor that might help would be area zones for faction pvp, what I mean is that certain areas would be designated for pvp faction fighting, like an arena. Int the same way you could make a certain area be able to be attacked for the time being, and just warn players what areas are under pvp faction fighting.

Cause with the different zones it could be set up so that a certain zone could be let out for war.

How about having a check box that you check if you want to be able to attack others that have the box checked and you are willing to be attacked by others. So then when you want to just go kill monsters or do a quest then you just uncheck the box. If your in the middle of a battle then you can't uncheck, you just have to run or attack. Then you're giving your consent and you would not have to ask someone to battle. Also then you can have big battles instead of just one vs one.

How about something a bit more realistic?

Here's my idea:

Faction PvP works like normal. A lvl 99 orc can attack lvl 1 humans. So, yeah, the orc will likely own any humans they come across.

Getting there's another story.

Between Horde and Alliance lands, there is a large no-mans-land. On the respective neutral zone borders of the Horde and Alliance, small patrols (5 lvl 30 guys) roam the area, attacking any enemy troops on sight. Each patrol has one spellcaster on them. When the spellcaster dies, or the enemy retreats into Alliance territory, a signal goes to the nearest base, saying an enemy is coming. Then, not only are attack groups dispatched to hunt down the attacker, but all PC's in the area get a message saying that there is a lvl X intruder in zone Y.

This should have two effects.

First, all low lvl characters around area Y will run towards town.

Second, all high lvl characters looking for some exp will head towards there to take him out.

This is only a theory tho. Any thoughts?

I think thats an excelent idea wraithy. Do as much as is possible to make the players themselves take care of the problem. It could easily be as simple as the moment an orc warrior disembarks from his transport ship(from kalimdor) into alliance lands a quest is added to say the town gaurds (available for people orc warrior lv x +-5) to hunt down and kill this individual.

I think ofcourse there should also be nomans lands where anything goes. Enter this place and take your chances.

It could also work maybe this way, if your in your enemies territory, they can fight you whenever they want, but not vice versa. So you as an orc cannot initiate combat agaist humans while in human land, but they can do so at any time. (not sure if this solves problems though)


Dont take my advice seriously, I have never played an mmo, but these are my thoughts.

If anybody out there has played the very old text based online RPG, Sword of Chaos, you may know what I am talking about. In SOC, there were players who declared themselves outlaws. What that meant is that except in certain "safe zones", outlaws can attack any other outlaws, but ONLY other outlaws. Players that do not wish to be involved in PvP choose not to become outlaws. Once you were an outlaw however, you could not change back. Although in SOC, there were never quite as many people online as there will be in WOW, it was a system that worked extremely well. Although it was a little annoying to be honest to be an outlaw and get hammered by a much higher leveld player, it was never excessive. Besides, you should still have the option to report a malicious player to a nearby GM.

Just curious about yer thoughts on a setup similar to this.

Your dual bars system would work generally, though of course if someone jumped me under taht system, I probably wouldnt even keep fighting them, since they couldnt really affect me.

However, "real" faction PvP should take place in zones specifically marked as such, with objectives that really affect everyone in the world when captured.

Simple...

Just create a button that says "Allow Enemy Faction Attack"

And the button can only be CHECK inside a town... Meaning, you can't just check whenever you feel like it. So if someone just happen to be weaker than you next to you outside field, you can't uncheck your button unless you go back to down...etc.

Plus i think there should be 3 different Realms if possible. Where one Realm server is FRIENDLY enviroment, no pvp, just peace... While the other one is all war... And the last one is half peace and half war.

Or maybe lets just make a place where all battles can be take place, but not any others. Meaning, there will be a speical "PLACE" for people who like to fight.

If you really wanted to see how faction PvP done... Maybe you guys can go read some Lineage information...

Wraith!

That's an interesting idea, but still a problem.

When you've got a World with 3000 players, you'll have this sort of message running every 5 minutes. If low leveled players kept running back to base whenever such a alarm sounds, they'll never be able to complete any quests. And if they don't, they'll be PKed by a Level 50 Grunt.

That will once again serve to annoy casual players to the point of quitting the game.

However, that's certainly a feature that should be inplemented anyway. In additon the PVP Mechanics I suggested, it would certainly be cool :)

Personally, I really enjoy the idea of Epic Warfare. Few games have succeeded well in creating it, but Blizzard hasn't disappointed me yet.

I believe that a system which utilized a set of zones which factions could declare war in would be nice. It would give an element of player involvment as well as providing the means to fight epic battles. It could have the potential to really give the game the feel of warring factions.

Alternative to having players decide where to fight, use designated war zones. They could be populated with npc soldiers, and designed to really look like a battlefield. It could even be turned into a place where quests could be given to reinforce an area, or seek and destroy objects/npcs, ect. A lot of things could be done with it.

I like wraithfighter's idea as well. Outposts around the borders to report enemy movements in an area specific channel would also enhance the feel of warring factions. Camps near outposts sending out skirmish parties would be interesting.

Im not entirely sure what the atmosphere of the game is supposed to be like. Are the factions engaging in all out war? I suppose I should have asked that before posting? :p

Here is my solution.
CODE

-------------   A
|                 |
|                 |
|                 |
-------------   X
|                 |
|                 |
|                 |
-------------  B


A would be a horde area. B is an Alliance area.

X is the "battleground".

Allow there to be faction PvP only in the "battleground". THe battleground would be between the two sides areas. This way you don't have to worry about greifing. There could be NPC guards in the back.

X would move back and forth depending on who is winning the battle, but there would be diminishing returns such that it never crosses a certain area. The more area each side controls, the more benefits. But since it's only to a certain point, no one side can completely dominate the game.

Benefits: There is a reward for winning the faction battles, that is you maintain a large territory in the area between the two sides. The two main islands in WoW are already set up like this, all that would have to change is the area in the middle of them be declared a giant Faction PvP zone, with extra bonuses in those areas, which the factions would fight over. Since there is diminishing returns on territory, that is only a certain area you can take over, no one side can completely dominate and the other can always catch up. Also since there are two main islands, two battles going on mean it can always be interesting even if one side dominates one battle.

Drawbacks: Enforcing the limit on territory would be strange. Either invisible wall or NPC guards behind the battlefield. Of course people would be saying, "Why dont those NPCs help us?" and so it would be very unrealistic.

Actually, the idea calls for both PC's ganging up on the intruders and NPC's. Not all NPC's have to be low level wusses. We're in the middle of war. Its perfectly plausible that each side has patrols of lvl 30-40 NPC's.

DW, you do have a point regarding the large amount of times the message would go off, but remember that low lvl characters tend to stick to some areas, because that's where the quests are. Higher lvl characters would get more quests near the border, and the low level characters would be too far in the interior of the nations to be in a direct threat, and only players near there would get the message.

And also, remember the no-mans-land area. That way encountering patrols would not be very common. A lot of it would have to do with setting of variables to make it work better.

But thanks for teh praise!

EDIT: Oh, and btw...

i think deathwings idea is the best so far. his idea sounds really cool, and would work! i know i woudnt want to duel as a low level, but when i do duel, i want to be involved in a huge battle that has a purpose... even if that purpos is to defend a base, it still would be fun as all hell. plus i wouldnt have to worry about dying while im questing. and the rest penalty when you lose is a great insentive for PvPs...

the other ideas sound like they may work, but they dont sound as fun as deathwings idea, or as sound.

With the exception of specific PvP servers, World of Warcraft will be a consensual PvP game. There will be specific zones and battlefields where players can fight each other and conversely, zones (newbie zones for sure) where you can not.

We hope to start testing a PvP server sometime in the future and will work these issues out at that time.

So on the non-PVP's it will be your choice to fight, with zones you can and zones you can't. I havn't seen anything said about how the actual PVP servers will be handled, however. Bliz'll cross that bridge when we come to it. Maybe we'll see something like this system implimented!

If you make a character on a non-PvP server are you able to switch to a PvP server?

GuestL In general, players cannot switch their character beteen servers, so no :(. And here lies the problem with a Dedicated PVP Server.

Even if everyone who joins such a server is all for PVP, your going to see so many creep jacking scenerios as I mentioned above. And since to get high levelled, players need to do quests anyway, you're gonna see so much frustration. People camped over other people's corpses...

Just Imagine a Vancleef following your ppor Level 7 Character around... the only people who're going to have fun are they very few high levelled people. The server wouldn't take off too well.

Hmm...I see your point. I hope Blizz seriously considers this, because I've talked with friends, and we have yet to figure out any downside to this system. It's a great idea! Maybe we should get some of our IC WoW players to reply to the suggestions post ^_^

I see no problem with open PvP. I played Ultima for over a year and there were no restrictions on combat what-so-ever (this was not on a dedicated PvP server). If you were out hunting, yes, a PKer could run in and kill you. Whats more, upon death you dropped ALL OF YOUR ITEMS.

Is that so harsh? I don't think so. In fact I thoroughly enjoyed being hunted down by a PKer. What's more, the difference between mid-level chars and high-level chars was not excessive. This was not Diablo where a lvl 50 barb can kill your lvl 30 in one hit. Usually me and a friend, both relatively casual players, could take on any single PKer in the game.

So what happens if a bunch of powerful PKers get together? Well, first off, the PKers were not very organized at all. In fact, the time I spent as a PK I was killed by other PKs many times over the number of times I was killed by the "blues". But occasionally a group would form, and a group of blues would form to take them on. It's that simple.

Did I get PKed alot? I'd say a decent amount, sure. Did I kill alot of PKs? A few, sure. Was the system fun? You'd better believe it.

Unfortunately, Ultima adopted a "region" PvP system. They made a complete copy of the world, and made it impossible to PK there. Of course, that's where everyone stayed, and there really isn't any decent PK in Ultima anymore. That's why I quit.

ezra, the problem is that you're limiting the experience to yourself. I think Deathwing's idea is excellent, and really satisfies the whole (or a least a mayor part) of the community. I'd LOVE to play one of those epic battles.

Ezra:

The problem here is that World of Warcraft is going to be Faction PVP game, in a way, we want to encourage PKing, cause how the hell else ar eyou going to see massive battles.

If any Orc can attack human, orcs can band together and kill human newbs just fine.

Drop all your items? In WOW, that's basically saying 'Start a new character'. If you're Level 15, and you drop all your items, it'll take you 4 days to get anywher near where you are before. heck, its harder than the first time, since you want have Quest Item Rewards to sell. getting gold will be HARD, and what if you get Pked again?

Two Pks and you can bet that a casual player will quit the game forever. And if all you got is a few hundred hardcores, no more epic battles. Hick, who's insane enough to join an epic battle if it means that there character is baiscally screwed forever?

i still think DW's first idea is the best yet, simply because it can be used for full PVP. Yes, an alliance warrior bashing an alliance wizard is annoying, but sometimes people can be really, really annoying. Lineage 2, though full PVP, because of the penalties for killing someone, ends you up with a game where "being an arsehole" is the approved method of PVP. If someone KS's you (granted, this doesn't happen in WoW), you KS them because there isn't much else you CAN do. And so on.
